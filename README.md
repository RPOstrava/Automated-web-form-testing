# Automated-web-form-testing


1st phase - The project will be focused on automated testing of basic operations on the web form, including filling, sending and verifying the display of the confirmation page.
          Loading the page, rejecting cookies and logging in to the account name then works. I just can't send the password


          
2nd phase - We will test different language versions of the website and verify that switching between languages works correctly




3rd phase - Testing links to articles in different languages are set up correctly and lead to relevant pages.
